  [zupo]


0.5.0 (2020-03-07)
------------------

* [BREAKING CHANGE] Move `openapi_validation_error` from `examples/todoapp`
  into the main package so it becomes a first-class citizen and people can use
  it without copy/pasting. If you need custom JSON rendering, you can provide
  your own `extract_errors` function via `pyramid_openapi3_extract_errors`
  config setting.
  [zupo]

* Upgrade `openapi-core` to `0.13.x` which brings a complete rewrite of the
  validation mechanism that is now based on `jsonschema` library. This
  manifests as different validation error messages.

  [BREAKING CHANGE] By default, `openapi-core` no longer creates models
  from validated data, but returns `dict`s. More info on
  https://github.com/p1c2u/openapi-core/issues/205

0.4.1 (2019-10-22)
