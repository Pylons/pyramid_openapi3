    This tween should run after pyramid exception renderer view, so that
    final response status and content_type are known and can be validated.

    The only problem here is, that when response validation fails, we have
    to return some exception response, with an unknown content type.
    The advantage is, that these are server errors, and if 500 errors are
    only possible due to response validation errors we don't need to document
    them in the openapi spec file.
